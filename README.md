## üöó Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

### üìå Overview

The **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is an optimization problem where a salesman must visit all cities **exactly once** and return to the starting point while minimizing travel costs.

#### Assumptions:
- The problem is formulated in **Euclidean space**.
- The distance matrix **C** is **symmetric**, meaning:  
  **c(i,j) = c(j,i)**.
- The **triangle inequality** holds:  
  **c(i,k) ‚â§ c(i,j) + c(j,k)** for all **i, j, k** in the set of cities.

### Graph Representation

The problem can be represented as an **undirected graph** **G = (V, A)**, where:
- **V** is the set of cities.
- **A** is the set of edges with non-negative weights corresponding to distances.

The goal is to find the **shortest Hamiltonian cycle**, a path that visits each city **exactly once** and returns to the start.

### Solving TSP using the Hill-Climbing Algorithm

### Key Objectives:
- Design and implement a **suitable encoding method** for TSP.
- Define an **objective function** to evaluate the quality of solutions.
- Explore different **neighborhood variants** for state transitions.
- Implement a method for **enumerating neighboring states**.
- Introduce a mechanism to **escape local optima**, such as **random restarts**.

### Algorithm Configuration

The following parameters can be adjusted:

- **Input File**: Specifies the dataset containing city distances.
- **Starting City**: Defines the city where the route begins.
- **Neighbor Selection Variant**:
  - **Variant 1**: Swaps two random cities in the path.
  - **Variant 2**: Swaps only adjacent cities.
- **Maximum Iterations**: Controls the limit for optimization steps.
- **Maximum Restarts**: Defines the number of attempts to escape local optima.

### Implementation Details

#### Steps:
1. **Load Data** ‚Äì Reads the distance matrix from a dataset.
2. **Initialize Solution** ‚Äì Generates a random route covering all cities.
3. **Generate Neighboring Solutions**:
   - **Method 1**: Swaps two randomly selected cities.
   - **Method 2**: Swaps only adjacent cities.
4. **Evaluate Solutions** ‚Äì Computes the total distance for each path.
5. **Select the Best Neighbor** ‚Äì Chooses the shortest route among generated neighbors.
6. **Iterate Until Convergence** ‚Äì Repeats the process until no better solution is found.
7. **Handle Local Optima** ‚Äì Uses restart strategies if the algorithm gets stuck.

## üêç Intelligent Snake Game AI  

### üìå Overview  
This project focuses on designing an **intelligent AI agent** for the classic **Snake game**. The goal is to create an **adaptive agent** that can navigate the game grid, collect food, and **avoid self-collisions** while maximizing survival time.  

The implemented agent follows **goal-based AI principles**, leveraging **heuristic search algorithms** for optimal pathfinding.  

### Problem Definition  
- The **Snake** moves on a **2D grid**, following a path where its **body trails behind the head**.  
- The objective is to **collect food (apples)**, growing in length with each consumption.  
- The challenge is to **avoid colliding with itself** or the game boundaries.  
- The environment is **partially observable** since the Snake only has limited information about the grid.  

### AI Agent Approach  
Instead of relying on a **basic reflex agent** (which makes **random moves** to avoid obstacles), the implemented agent:  
1. **Calculates an optimal path** to the apple using a selected search algorithm.  
2. **Follows the planned path** step by step, **minimizing the risk of getting trapped**.  
3. **Handles dead-end situations** by generating an **imaginary apple**‚Äîa temporary target that allows the Snake to maneuver until a real path to the actual apple becomes available.  

### Algorithms Used  
The AI agent is implemented using **heuristic search techniques**, including:  
- **A* Algorithm** (Optimal pathfinding with a heuristic)  
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (Uniform cost search)  
- **Greedy Search** (Fast but not always optimal)  

At the start of the game, the user selects which **algorithm** will control the Snake.  

### Implementation Details  
- **Language:** Python üêç  
- **Visualization:** Implemented using **Pyglet**, a Python graphics library.  
- **Heuristic Used:** **Manhattan Distance** for evaluating path costs.  

### Pathfinding Strategy  
1. When an **apple appears**, the Snake calculates the best path using the chosen **search algorithm**.  
2. If no valid path exists (due to the Snake‚Äôs own body blocking it), the agent **creates an imaginary apple** at a reachable position to buy time.  
3. The Snake moves towards the **imaginary apple** until a real path to the actual apple is available.  
4. If the Snake becomes trapped with no escape, it **fails** and the game ends.
